# **Abstract**

Cybersecurity threats pose significant risks to individuals and organizations, leading to data breaches, financial losses, and operational disruptions. 
This presentation explores key threats such as malware, phishing, DDoS attacks, insider threats, and zero-day exploits. 
It also discusses mitigation strategies, including network security measures, multi-factor authentication, encryption, and incident response planning. 
Through case studies of real-world cyber incidents, I highlight lessons learned and best practices to strengthen security defenses. 
The goal is to enhance awareness and promote proactive cybersecurity measures in an increasingly digital world.
